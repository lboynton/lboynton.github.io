Hello. This is the personal website of Lee Boynton.

I am:

- Primarily a PHP web developer, though have experience of everything from Linux system administration, back-end development and front-end development
- Currently working at [eDigitalResearch](http://www.edigitalresearch.com) (near Southampton, UK) as a Software Engineer
- Involved with [PHP Hampshire](http://www.phphants.co.uk) where I help organise meet ups (Get in touch on Twitter if you'd like to speak at one of our events!)

See my [CV](http://cv.lboynton.com) and [GitHub](http://github.com/lboynton) profile where I occasionally find the time to contribute to open source software.
