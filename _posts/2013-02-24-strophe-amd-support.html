<p>A little while ago, a spent some time hacking in AMD support to <a title="Strophe.js" href="http://strophe.im/strophejs/" target="_blank">Strophe.js</a>, a client-side XMPP library. So far it hasn't been merged, but if you are interested please comment on the <a href="https://github.com/metajack/strophejs/pull/99" target="_blank">pull request</a>. It would be nice to get this added in so that we can continue to use Strophe as the world slowly moves towards more modular code using something like AMD or ES6 modules.</p>
