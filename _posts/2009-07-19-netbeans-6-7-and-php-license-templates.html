<p>It seems there is a bug in NetBeans 6.7 which means that PHP projects do not work correctly with license templates. If you specify a license to use in the nbproject/project.properties file, the template file does not seem to read that key, and thus the default template is used. This has been fixed in the <a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/nightly/" target="_blank">daily builds</a>, bug report is <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=167661" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
