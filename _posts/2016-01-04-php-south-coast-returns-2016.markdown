Another quick note, almost exactly one year on from my last, to say that PHP South Coast conference is returning for a second year. This time [PHPHants](http://www.phphants.co.uk/), [PHPDorset](http://www.phpdorset.co.uk) and [BrightonPHP](http://brightonphp.org) are also being aided by volunteers from [PHP Berkshire](http://www.meetup.com/PHP-Berkshire/), [PHP Surrey](http://phpsurrey.uk/) and [PHP South West](https://phpsw.uk/) to put on an awesome community conference on the south coast of the UK.

If you are interested in speaking, please submit your talk ideas on the [conference website](http://2016.phpsouthcoast.co.uk). There will be full 50 minute slots available along with shorter 20 minute lightning style slots for people who are looking to get into conference speaking for the first time, or just prefer to get it over with quicker!

Please note that the call for speakers ends soon, on the 12th January 2016.

If you are not quite yet ready to speak at a conference, but would like to attend, that is also possible! Tickets are available (currently at a very reasonable blind bird price!), also on the [conference website](http://2016.phpsouthcoast.co.uk).
