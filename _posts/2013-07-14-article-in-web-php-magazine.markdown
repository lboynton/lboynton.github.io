I recently wrote an article for [Web & PHP Magazine](http://webandphp.com/ "Web & PHP")Â about how you can start using Node.js on your PHP website and shows off a real-time news feed using redis. It talks about sharing PHP session data with Node, and in it I use loads of cool technologies like redis, Socket.IO, bower and composer.
