<p>I recently wrote an article for <a title="Web &amp; PHP" href="http://webandphp.com/">Web &amp; PHP Magazine</a>Â about how you can start using Node.js on your PHP website and shows off a real-time news feed using redis. It talks about sharing PHP session data with Node, and in it I use loads of cool technologies like redis, Socket.IO, bower and composer.</p>
