A belated note to say that PHPHants are joining forces with [PHPDorset](http://www.phpdorset.co.uk) and [BrightonPHP](http://brightonphp.org) to put on a conference on the south coast of England, in Portsmouth! If you are interested in speaking, please submit your talk ideas on the [conference website](http://2015.phpsouthcoast.co.uk). There will be full 50 minute slots available along with shorter 20 minute lightning style slots available for those looking to get into conference speaking, or just prefer to get it over with quicker!

Please note that the call for papers ends soon, on the 12th January.

If you are not quite yet ready to speak at a conference, but would like to attend, that is also possible! Tickets are available (currently at a very reasonable blind bird price!), also on the [conference website](http://2015.phpsouthcoast.co.uk).
